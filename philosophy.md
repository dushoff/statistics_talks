Add confidence interval logic to paradigms!

More about clarity when confidence intervals are difficult

	What would be a good example?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

History

Obviously developed for MMED and spread weirdly to DAIDD

Been given in several other places, I guess.

There was a clarity version given at Hamilton Hall which has maybe been largely merged in.

Gave it at QMEE 2024 apparently!

Suggested by Andrei for NCTS 2025. Student statistical engagement surprisingly weak.

2017 notes

* https://twitter.com/mlipsitch/status/838494026726789125. Dangers of under-powered studies. Outside the scope

* https://twitter.com/ken_rothman/status/862016511724183553 Debates about a JAMA that accepted the null hypothesis. Fun but not necessary.

* http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124 Why most published research findings are false. Good, but a null-hypothesis believer. Outside the scope.

* Non-inferiority trial example’s great but probably went to fast for most of the audience
* MMEV: Need to have 1 slide with all the relevant info (ie, add the Question you’ve posed to the Example slide!)

* for pred value positive, give extreme where there’s 0% prevalence to make it clear
