Coverage represents
The probability that your estimate is correct
The probability that the null hypothesis is true
The probability that your confidence interval contains the true value
The size of your confidence interval
3

The direct interpretation of a low P value is that
Our confidence intervals are small
The effect we are measuring is important
We have seen something about the effect clearly
We have a good model

In this lecture the difference between model validation and model evaluation is that
Validation tests the null hypothesis and evaluation tests the alternative hypothesis
Validation is based on P values and evaluation is not
Only validation is used to test hypotheses
Validation is done in the model world, and evaluation is done in the real world
