* https://twitter.com/mlipsitch/status/838494026726789125. Dangers of under-powered studies. Outside the scope

* https://twitter.com/ken_rothman/status/862016511724183553 Debates about a JAMA that accepted the null hypothesis. Fun but not necessary.

* http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124 Why most published research findings are false. Good, but a null-hypothesis believer. Outside the scope.

* Non-inferiority trial example’s great but probably went to fast for most of the audience
* MMEV: Need to have 1 slide with all the relevant info (ie, add the Question you’ve posed to the Example slide!)

* for pred value positive, give extreme where there’s 0% prevalence to make it clear
