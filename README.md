Conversion (roughly):
* make rum
* make hybridignore
* make rup
* git status

Importing
* make rum
* make rup
* Is update --init the problem?
	* Not according to documentation

* Need to work on auto-makestuff weird commits. I made a note.

Dotdir
* Does not work out of the box because modules don't get initialized or updated â€“ fix in modules.mk?

This is a directory for stats-y talks, mostly developed with ICI3D or the somewhat-related NTU course.

It is meant to find its own resources on github and link them, but it has not yet been set up in a systematic way.
